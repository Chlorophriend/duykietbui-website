I talked to one of my prof for a chance to do directed studies in the next semester if my grad school application does not work out. They gave me a business card on their job as an MLM salesman and seemed to propose me a job in that as well. Weirded me out a little bit, and I don't know how to get in touch again since I said I will get in touch with them about that. Weird.
