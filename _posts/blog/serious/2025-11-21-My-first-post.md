This is my first post ever on my own website yay! I'm trying to make the front page a bit more dynamic. Will be slowly working on a pixel art (even though I'm tempted to just GenAI it). I was not from a background of arts, but I consider this my little hobby project where I leave a healthy footprint on the Internet. My idea is to create a Spirited Away train, and animate it to be around 12FPS.

I first wanted to write down my thoughts on some social media platforms like Facebook or Threads (yes, egotistical of me to think what I have to think matters at all). I contemplated about if I write for myself or for others, and I think I would prefer to write for myself. I left a facet of mine here, hoping it would be found and read by the ones that care about me, so I would have this pseudo feeling of belongingness, as an attempt to run away from loneliness (like every other human being). I also think my future self would appreciate what my past self has to offer, in case he wants to look back and does some self-reflections. 

Thank you everyone and I, to give me such a privileged life (not a suicidal note). I will keep you posted and I hope I alleviated some of your boredom by reading some real person's secret notes.
