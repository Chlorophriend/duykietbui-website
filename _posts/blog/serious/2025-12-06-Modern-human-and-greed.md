2/3 of Canadians aged 25-64 have post-secondary credentials. Canada is top-ranked worldwide in terms of post-secondary degree completion rates. But 40% of recent graduates are overqualified for the jobs that they do.

I (soon will) have a psychology degree. From a unidimensional perspective of money making, my degree is useless because I won't make money working in the psychology field with my feeble psychology level. This unidimensional perspective is adopted mostly among those who are making money, those who are a generation older than me. And I totally understand their perspective of greed. I think modern humans are all greedy. 

My grandfather is most greedy of love. He was born into a poor family of farmer parents, like 99% of Vietnamese families after the war against the U.S. ended (Vietnamese hate calling it Vietnam War). His family was war-torn. A few of his 10+ siblings sacrificed during war. He has undiagnosed Narcissistic Personality Disorder. He yearns for nothing but unconditional love and admiration, through gaslighting or through violence against his spouse, kins, and offspring. He is a poor, despicable, pitiful, ill man in that way. 

My father is most greedy of material. His hedonistic gambling father did not provide enough for the family. He in turn tried to make money as fast as possible, and it kicked him in the ass, so hard that it made him the man with most regrets. Even though barred, he wanted me to be raised without thirst for materials, and I had a fulfilling childhood. 

Self-reflections fill me with insurmountable icks every time, but I am most greedy of knowledge. It is almost that my father's greed on me was fulfilled, that I chase the next one. I am anything but ungrateful for it. I realized how behind my country is about science development, even in the big 25. We are still playing a chasing game, trying to follow footsteps of other national giants. I can only imagine my country having statistics on provincial discrimination, gender discrimination, domestic violence,... and I want to realize that. Such greed of mine. I want to have the tools and powers to spread knowledge to underprivileged Vietnamese. There are just so many Mountainers who still don't consistently have meat to eat every meal, Centralers who struggle to survive man-made floods, Sapa children whose full-time jobs are to entertain tourists to sell merch. Egalitarianism is such a far-fetched goal for us, though possible, if we somehow shrink the enormous income disparity in this supposedly socialist nation. I want to believe that income and suffering disparity lie in knowledge disparity. I'm young and hot-headed, and I have absolute trust in my greed to take me to a position where I can substantially help my people.
